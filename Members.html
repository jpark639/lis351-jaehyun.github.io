			<h2 class="member-name">Minji</h2>
			<p class="member-role">Sub Vocalist</p>
			<p class="member-description">Its unique calm and light tone is attractive. In general, it is a tone that is clearly distinguished from other members, and it mainly plays a mid-low-pitched part rather than a high-pitched part, and is close to a mid-low-pitched vocal.</p>

			<h2 class="member-name">Hanni</h2>
			<p class="member-role">Main vocalist</p>
			<p class="member-description">The basic skills are very solid in various fields such as diction, vocal volume, tone, vocal range, lyric delivery power, and live stability. It features a clear and refreshing tone that gives a soft yet solid feeling along with even vocalization, showing strength in the middle and high-pitched range, and its great advantage is that its Korean pronunciation is natural despite being a foreign member.</p>

			<h2 class="member-name">Daniel</h2>
			<p class="member-role">free role</p>
			<p class="member-description">The vocal range is wide, and it shows that both mature and feminine low tones and powerful high tones are well performed. While middle and high-pitched sounds are bright and high-pitched, low-pitched sounds give a calm and arrogant feeling in contrast.</p>

			<h2 class="member-name">Haerin</h2>
			<p class="member-role">Main Dancer</p>
			<p class="member-description">Overall, he is a member who is mentioned as a dance along with Hanni in a group whose dance skills have been upgraded. The duet performances with Hani, who has many brilliant movements, also received very good responses. He dances sophisticatedly and rhythmically based on solid basic skills. I enjoy listening to hip-hop, but the dance is also highly evaluated by the members by making good use of hip-hop-based dances.</p>

			<h2 class="member-name">Hyein</h2>
			<p class="member-role">Sub Dancer</p>
			<p class="member-description">Basically, the dance line is cool and clean because the arms and legs are long. It is characterized by its outstanding body to show its ability to dominate the stage even at a young age and its power in both group stages and solo dance.</p>
