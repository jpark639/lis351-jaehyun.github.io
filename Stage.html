			<h2>Ditto</h2>
			<p>The pre-released song "Ditto" is a track specially prepared for the first winter with Bernice. The warm and cozy Choir Pad sound and classical Old School Drum Break are attractive songs, reinterpreting the Baltimore Club Dance Music genre with NewJeans' own emotions. Affection and palpitation are melted in various musical elements, especially the dreamy yet unique humming that appears at the beginning of the song implies the winter of New Jeans.</p>

			<h2>Attention</h2>
			<p>The song expresses the excitement as proudly as the key change between Minor and Major. Following the groovy sense of the intro, the chorus with rich and refreshing chords of the members is impressive. The key point is the beat where you can feel the mysterious groove. It is the most New Jeans-like song that accepts the excitement and excitement that came with that heart honestly and confidently and declares "Attention to me."</p>

			<h2>OMG</h2>
			<p>Based on hip-hop drum sources and percussion, it is a bouncy and exciting hip-hop R&B song created by moving between UK Garage rhythm and Trap rhythm. NewJeans' trendy tone is expressed in various styles such as Pop Vocal and Melodic Rap, so you can see another personality and charm.</p>

			<h2>Hypeboy</h2>
			<p>The sound of combining Moombahton and ElectroPop is attractive with unique free chorus, and the unique singing of the members in each part. It shows another chic color of NewJeans and makes you focus until the end once you listen to it. And the story of this song is divided into several parts.</p>
